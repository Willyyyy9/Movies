## Notes
This project was inspired from a task in Google's [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) course in Udacity. <br/>
All vectors and icons were downloaded from [FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.com/). <br/>
[StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and other similar websites were used to assist me in developing this app.
The URLs of the MovieDB API is missing the key, you can register and get your own key.
